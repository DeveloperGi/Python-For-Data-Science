Recently in 2017, Instacart had released the Dataset which contains a sample of 3 million grocery store orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users. 

Each user, has 4 to 100 of their orders, with the sequence of products purchased in each order.It also provides the week and hour of day the order was placed, and a relative measure of time between orders.

Function: freq(obj) Returns the count of the item and item_pairs, If the input to function is series then return the count, else change the Dataframe to the Series and return the count by using Counter function in Python.
3. Finding the Users having likeness for the same Products using TFIDF.
4. Identification of Customer Segments using PCA and KMeans
